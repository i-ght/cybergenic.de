Upon a fateful day, a recruiter did beckon me back into the service of a wretched tech realm. The discourse reached the juncture of drug tests, and thus did I begin my inquiries.

Quoth I, "Pray, good sir, which elixirs doth thou seek?"
He replied, "... t'would be the elixirs of the streets."
I pressed further, "But what, by the grace of chivalry, art 'street elixirs'?"
He, caught like a hare in the hound's pursuit, found himself bereft of speech.

With greater fervor, I ventured, "Allow me to fathom this aright: dost thou wish to inspect mine urine through a glass arcane?"
Stuttering and stumbling, he struggled to conjure coherent words.
"Art not these tests but a curious obsession with tainted fluids?" I proclaimed boldly, the gauntlet of mockery cast.

And lo, he bid his farewell and with that, I severed our connection like a knight's swift sword through the air.
