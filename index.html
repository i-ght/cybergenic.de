        Mock my code mercilessly:<br><br>

    <ol>
        <li>The Mystery of the Reversed Lists: Ah, the thrill of reversing lists at every corner! It's like a suspense
            novel where we never know what order things will be in. Will the hero be at the beginning or the end? The
            suspense is killing me!</li>
        <li>Exceptional Use of Exceptions: You're throwing around exceptions like confetti at a parade. Who doesn't love
            a good surprise party for their code? "You get an exception, and you get an exception, everybody gets an
            exception!"</li>
        <li>StringBuilder Obsession: StringBuilder, the unsung hero of your code. You've taken "premature optimization"
            to a whole new level. I can picture you building sandcastles with it at the beach.</li>
        <li>Name, Rename, Re-rename: It's like you're playing a game of "Guess the Variable Name." Will it be reader,
            reader, or maybe reader? Keeps us on our toes, for sure!</li>
        <li>HTML Artistry: Who needs a WYSIWYG editor when you can handcraft HTML like a true artisan? Forget Bootstrap;
            we've got navCode!</li>
        <li>The Quest for Efficiency: Why use one collection type when you can use three? Lists, dictionaries, and
            arrays, oh my! You're collecting collections like they're rare Pokémon.</li>
        <li>Tag Trimming Extravaganza: split, trim, split, trim—it's a tag-trimming tango! You've got a thing for
            trimming strings, and you're not afraid to show it.</li>
        <li>Commentary MIA: Comments are for the weak, right? Your code is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an
            enigma. Good luck to anyone trying to understand it without a treasure map.</li>
        <li>String Concatenation Ballet: Your code twirls through strings with the grace of a ballerina. It's like a
            beautiful dance, but with strings. Bravo!</li>
        <li>Date-to-HTML Translator: Who needs Rosetta Stone when you have htmlFilename? It's like translating dates
            into a secret HTML language only you understand.</li>
    </ol>
